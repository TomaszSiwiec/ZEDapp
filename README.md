# ZEDapp

Microservices system for order management. Web application which allows us to 
add, edit and delete external or internal orders. Additionally we can make statistics about our orders, 
 manage our employees, make list of products to buy. We can store all information and files which belongs to 
specify order. Thanks to this application we have access to management of our company from each device 
with internet connection from all places in the world. Finally will be added android application for 
employees(mainly drivers etc.). ZEDapp is scalable application so huge
app traffic does not affect the quality of usage.
